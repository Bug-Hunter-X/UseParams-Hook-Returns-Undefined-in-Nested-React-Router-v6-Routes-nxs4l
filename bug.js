In React Router Dom v6, a common error occurs when using the `useParams` hook within a component nested deeply within multiple route components.  The error manifests as the `params` object being undefined or empty even when the URL clearly indicates the presence of parameters. This often happens when routes are defined with nested structures, and a parent route's params are not properly passed down to children.  For instance, if you have a route like `/products/:productId/reviews/:reviewId`, and you try accessing `reviewId` in the nested `reviews` component without careful route structure and prop passing, `useParams` will return an empty object.

```javascript
// Incorrect implementation
<Route path='/products/:productId/reviews/:reviewId' element={<Reviews/>}/>

function Reviews(){
  const {reviewId} = useParams();
  //reviewId is undefined 
}
```
